# Machine Learning Model on the Breast Cancer Dataset.
# To Predict the features most significant for predicting the type of cancer.
# Our goal to create the optimum model for predicting Benign(B) or Malignant(M) cancer.

# In the independent variable we observe their being two sets of values (B and M)  so we consider this to be a classification problem
# Now we apply the  different types of Classification Algorithms on our training and testing sets 
# Then we analyse their accuracy and take the model with the highest accuracy to be the best fit for our problem
