## Machine Learning mini-Project on a Venture Capitalist Fund Problem
A Venture capitalist fund has provided us with a dataset of 50 companies and has tasked us with the goal to determine about investing in which companies will offer them the maximum profit.

## Motivation
Why this project exists is mostly because of me trying to implement the the ML algorithms I have been learning and get a hang of the practical  aspects of Machine Learning.

 

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>

## Features
Determines the best company to invest in to gain maximum profit using Multiple Linear Regression in Backward Elimination and determining the best model possible by analysing the adj.R-squared values

## Libraries Used
sklearn, numpy, matplotlib, pandas.


## Credits
I gathered the knowledge for this project from the following [Udemy Machine Learning Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)
